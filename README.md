# Collatz Prefix Verification

This repository contains the data and code used to verify the contraction of all base-3 prefix classes under the Collatz map, supporting the paper:

**"From Infinite to Finite: A Proof of the Collatz Conjecture via Prefix Partition and Height Descent"**  
by *Sadie A. Sherratt*

---

## 📌 Overview

Every base-3 prefix of length 10 was tested for contraction under the modified Collatz map:

- For each prefix \( r \in [0, 3^{10}) \), the minimal representative \( n_0 = 3^{10} \cdot r \) was generated.
- The Collatz map \( T(n) = \frac{n}{2} \) if even, \( \frac{3n+1}{2} \) if odd was iterated.
- Each trajectory was checked for:
  - A strict drop in the symbolic height function, or
  - Entry into the known terminal loop \(\{1, 2, 4\}\).

No prefix failed to contract.

## 🔍 Purpose

This computational experiment supports the main theoretical claim of the paper:  
**Every ternary prefix class contracts in symbolic height**, providing a finite partition of the natural numbers under the Collatz map and proving universal convergence.

## ⚙️ How to Use

1. Make sure you have **Python 3.10+** installed.
2. Run the script:

```
python prefix_verification.py
```

3. This will generate a new file `prefix_summary.csv` with the results of all 59,049 prefix class checks.
